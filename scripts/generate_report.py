"""
Generate a self-contained HTML report for a BRAKER4 pipeline run.

The methods narrative is composed by `generate_methods_text(workdir, mode)`,
which inspects which output files exist on disk and writes one cohesive
paragraph in execution order. Rules do NOT contribute methods text directly.

Reads:
  - report_citations.txt: Plain-text citations (one per line, appended by rules)
  - report_citations.bib: BibTeX entries (appended by rules)
  - QC files: training_summary.png, busco_summary.txt, compleasm_summary.txt, etc.
  - Pipeline metadata: sample name, mode, date

Produces:
  - braker_report.html: Self-contained HTML with inline CSS and embedded images
  - braker_citations.bib: Deduplicated BibTeX file

Usage:
    python3 generate_report.py -d output/sample/ -o output/sample/results/
